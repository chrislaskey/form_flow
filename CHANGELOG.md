### Breaking: Renamed Graph to Flow

The stored diagram concept is now named what every other surface already
called it — routes, UI, and documentation all said "flow" while the data
layer said "graph". The rename is a hard cutover with no migration path: the
initial schema is rewritten in place (pre-release, no production installs).
Drop and recreate any existing database (`mix ecto.reset`).

Modules moved under the `Templates` namespace, beside
`FormFlow.Data.Templates.Form` — a flow definition is a design-time template
on the same axis as a form template:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `FormFlow.Data.Graphs` | `FormFlow.Data.Templates.Flows` |
| `FormFlow.Data.Graph` | `FormFlow.Data.Templates.Flow` |
| `FormFlow.Data.Graph.Node` | `FormFlow.Data.Templates.Flow.Node` |
| `FormFlow.Data.Graph.Relationship` | `FormFlow.Data.Templates.Flow.Relationship` |

Tables were renamed, and the `graph_` segment dropped from the child tables —
nothing else in the schema has nodes or relationships:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `form_flow_graphs` | `form_flow_flows` |
| `form_flow_graph_nodes` | `form_flow_nodes` |
| `form_flow_graph_relationships` | `form_flow_relationships` |

Columns: `graph_id` is now `flow_id` (nodes, relationships), and
`owner_graph_id` is now `owner_flow_id` (flows, template forms). The
`"graph_id"` key the schemas copy into `properties` for the future Neo4j
dual-write is now `"flow_id"` — stored data written before this change will
not be adopted.

The web/editor contract renamed with it: the LiveView events are
`form_flow:flow_changed` and `form_flow:set_flow`, the editor bundle's mount
options take `flow` and return a `setFlow/1` handle, and
`FormFlow.Web.Helpers.ReactFlow.to_graph_attrs/1` is now `to_flow_attrs/1`.
The committed editor bundle was rebuilt.

`Node` and `Relationship` keep their Neo4j property-graph names, and the
Neo4j mapping (`guides/neo4j.md`) now targets `:Flow` nodes instead of
`:Graph`. Routes are unchanged — the web layer already spoke `/flows`.
